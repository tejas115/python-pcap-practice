# User Defined Modules

This folder contains Python programs that demonstrate how to create and use user-defined modules in Python. These examples are useful for learning how to organize code, reuse functions, and structure Python projects.

## Contents

- Example modules and scripts showing how to define functions and import them in other Python files.

## Usage

Import the user-defined modules in your Python scripts to use the functions and logic defined within them. Example:

```python
from my_module import my_function
```

## Purpose

These programs are designed for practice and exploration of creating and using custom modules in Python, helping users understand modular programming and code organization.
