# Handle Error

This folder contains Python programs that demonstrate error handling techniques using exceptions. The examples are designed for learning and practicing how to manage errors and unexpected input in Python scripts.

## Contents

- `captcha.py`: Implements a simple math captcha that prompts the user for an answer. The script uses `try`, `except`, and `assert` statements to validate input and handle errors, prompting the user to try again if the answer is incorrect or if an exception occurs.

## Usage

Run the Python file and follow the prompt:

```bash
python captcha.py
```

Enter your answer to the math question. The program will continue to prompt until the correct answer is provided.

## Purpose

These programs are intended for practice and exploration of Python's error handling mechanisms, suitable for beginners and those preparing for programming exams or interviews.
