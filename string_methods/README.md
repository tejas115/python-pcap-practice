# String Methods

This folder contains Python programs that demonstrate various string manipulation techniques and methods. The examples are designed for learning and practicing string operations in Python.

## Contents

- `sorting.py`: Demonstrates sorting characters in a string, type conversion between strings and numbers, and string concatenation. The script covers how to use `sorted()` on strings, convert between types for arithmetic, and combine values for different outcomes.

## Usage

Each Python file can be run independently. For example:

```bash
python sorting.py
```

The output will display results of arithmetic and string operations using sorted string data, type conversions, and concatenation.

## Purpose

These programs are intended for practice and exploration of Python's string methods, suitable for beginners and those preparing for programming exams or interviews.
