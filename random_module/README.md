# Random Module

This folder contains Python programs that demonstrate the use of randomness in various contexts. The examples are designed for learning and practicing Python programming, especially for topics involving randomization and probability.

## Contents

- `cards.py`: Implements a function to generate a random sample of 4 cards from a deck. The deck is created using provided lists of suits and ranks, and the function returns a random selection of cards.

## Usage

Each Python file can be run independently. For example, to run the card sampling program:

```bash
python cards.py
```

The output will display a random group of 4 cards from a standard deck.

## Purpose

These programs are intended for practice and exploration of Python's `random` module, suitable for beginners and those preparing for programming exams or interviews.
