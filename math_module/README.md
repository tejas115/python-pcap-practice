# PCAP Practice - Modules

This folder contains various Python programs focused on mathematical concepts and practice for the PCAP (Python Certified Associate Programmer) exam. Each module demonstrates a specific topic or function related to mathematics.

## Contents

- `is_triangle.py`: Contains logic to determine if three given sides can form a valid triangle.
- `math_lab1.py`: Includes basic math operations and practice problems.
- `math_random.py`: Demonstrates usage of random numbers in mathematical contexts.
- `trignometry.py`: Provides functions for trigonometric calculations, such as computing the area of a circle.

## Usage

Each Python file can be run independently. Some modules may prompt for user input to perform calculations. Example:

```bash
python trignometry.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter required values and view the results.

## Purpose

These modules are designed for learning and practicing Python programming with a focus on mathematical problems, suitable for beginners and those preparing for the PCAP certification.
