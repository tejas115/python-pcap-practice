# List Methods

This folder contains Python programs that demonstrate various operations and techniques involving lists and related data structures. The examples are designed for learning and practicing list manipulation, as well as exploring algorithms that use lists.

## Contents

- `cipher_decrypt.py`: Implements a simple decryption algorithm that shifts each letter in the input message back by one in the alphabet. Special handling is provided for 'A' and 'a', which wrap around to 'Z' and 'z' respectively. Non-alphabetic characters are preserved as-is.

## Usage

Run the Python file and follow the prompt:

```bash
python cipher_decrypt.py
```

Enter your encrypted message when prompted to see the decrypted output.

## Purpose

These programs are intended for practice and exploration of Python's list methods and related algorithms, suitable for beginners and those preparing for programming exams or interviews.
