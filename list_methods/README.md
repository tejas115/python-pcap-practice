# List Methods

This folder contains Python programs that demonstrate various operations and techniques involving lists and related data structures. The examples are designed for learning and practicing list manipulation, as well as exploring algorithms that use lists.

## Contents

- `list_methods.py`: Comprehensive examples of all major Python list methods, including `append`, `clear`, `copy`, `count`, `extend`, `index`, `insert`, `pop`, `remove`, `reverse`, and `sort`. Each method is demonstrated with sample code and expected outcomes, covering basic usage, advanced options (like sorting with keys), and edge cases.
- `cipher_decrypt.py`: Implements a simple decryption algorithm that shifts each letter in the input message back by one in the alphabet. Special handling is provided for 'A' and 'a', which wrap around to 'Z' and 'z' respectively. Non-alphabetic characters are preserved as-is.

## Usage

Run any Python file in this folder to see demonstrations of list methods or algorithms:

```bash
python list_methods.py
python cipher_decrypt.py
```

Follow the prompts or review the output to understand how each method works and what results to expect.

## Purpose

These programs are intended for practice and exploration of Python's list methods and related algorithms, suitable for beginners and those preparing for programming exams or interviews.
